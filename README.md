This is a simple utility to merge any pdf files. You can use any number of any pdf files

HOW TO MERGE PDFs in a SINGLE PDF FILE:
1. Move the program "merge_pdf.py" in any folder that contains all the PDFs you want to merge
2. Rename the files in the alphabetical order you want to have them in your output file
(you can skip this step if you do not care about the order of the merged file)
3. Run the program by writing "python3 merge_pdf.py"
the program will automatically find all the pdfs in its folder and merge them together

EASY.
